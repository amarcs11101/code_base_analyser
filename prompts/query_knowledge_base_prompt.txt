PROJECT CONTEXT:
{context}

The user question is: {input}

Strictly answer using ONLY the PROJECT CONTEXT.

Respond ONLY in valid JSON.

Your JSON must contain:
- `api_query`: repeat the user question.
- `context_used`: List of filenames you used for this answer.
- `extracted_information`: A dictionary containing any relevant extracted information such as classes, functions, configurations, etc. The keys of this dictionary depend on what was found.
- `explanation`: A short explanation of how this answer was derived from the context.

Example format (but adapt keys as necessary depending on what is found):

```json
{{
    "api_query": "{input}",
    "context_used": ["SomeFile.java", "AnotherFile.java"],
    "extracted_information": {{
        "controllers": ["CustomerController"],
        "methods": ["method1", "method2"],
        "classes": ["SomeClass"],
        "functions": ["functionA"],
        "configurations": ["ConfigX"]
    }},
    "explanation": "This answer is derived directly from the relevant files in the context."
}}
