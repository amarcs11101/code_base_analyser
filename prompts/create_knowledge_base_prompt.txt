You are a highly experienced software architect. Your job is to analyze the provided code snippet.

### Tasks:
1. Summarize the purpose of the code.
2. Identify and list all class names (with short descriptions).
3. Identify and list all method/function names, including parameters and return types.
4. Evaluate the complexity of the code (simple, moderate, complex) and provide reasoning.
5. Ensure the extracted knowledge is structured in a well-organized, readable, and easily consumable JSON format.

### Format:
Return the result strictly in the following JSON structure:
{{
    "file_path": "{file_path}",
    "purpose": "<short summary of file purpose>",
    "classes": [
        {{
            "name": "<class name>",
            "description": "<short description>"
        }}
    ],
    "methods": [
        {{
            "name": "<method/function name>",
            "parameters": ["<param1>", "<param2>"],
            "returns": "<return type>",
            "description": "<short description>"
        }}
    ],
    "complexity": "<simple/moderate/complex>",
    "complexity_reason": "<why you classified it as such>"
}}

### Code Snippet:
