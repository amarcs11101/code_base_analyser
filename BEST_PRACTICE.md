# Best Practices for Codebase Analysis via LLM
- Code Processing
    Avoid reading unnecessary files (.DS_Store, .git, logs) , from .gitignore file 
    Organize code logically: Api , config , utility , prompts template 
    Ensure paths and extensions are dynamically configurable.
    
- Chunking Mechanism
    Split by:
        Class boundaries (class, interface)
        Method boundaries (public, private, def)
        Respect LLM context window.
        Append metadata (filename, type) for traceability.

- LLM Usage
    Choose LLM based on:
        Context window (GPT-4-turbo 128k recommended)
        Code understanding capability
        Prompting:
            - Structured instructions: numbered, step-by-step.
            - Examples for expected output.
            - Use PydanticOutPutParse (LangChain) for structured JSON.

- Performance & Efficiency
        Batch requests where possible.
        Cache embeddings or analysis results for repeated runs.
        Monitor API usage to avoid unnecessary costs by chunking and also by storing the chunked insights inside vector db (in my case chroma db)

- Output Readability
    JSON should be:
        Human-readable (indentation, key ordering)
        Machine-readable (consistent schema)
        Provide examples within the documentation.

- Error Handling
    Gracefully handle:
        File read errors
        API timeouts
        Unexpected LLM outputs
        Fallbacks: skip file, log warning, continue processing.

- Security
        Avoid exposing API keys.
        Secure .env management.
        Sanitize any user-provided inputs.
